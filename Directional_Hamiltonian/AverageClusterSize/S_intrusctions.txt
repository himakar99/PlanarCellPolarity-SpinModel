How to use: S_data.c

1. Place the code in the folder containing the various run folders
2. Input the values of dimension of lattice (DIM), Number of data samples per run (DATA_SAMPLES), Starting folder (R_I), Final folder (R_F), and the name of the m3 folder.

Output: 
1. For a given value of m3 and DIM, the code combines the m1-m2 data across multiple runs to calculate Average Cluster Size and its standard error. 
2. The output is stored in the same folder as the runs are present in. 
3. Format of the output file is S_(lDIM)_(m3)_(m1-m2).csv
