Modifications:
1) Addition of new external field parameter m3. (mcmc function takes this as a parameter)
2) randSpin can now take values 0, 1, 2.
3) Energy_calc, a utility function to calculate total energy in main, has been modified in correspondence to the introduction of a new parameter to the hamiltonian.  
0 = All cells completely aligned in any of the 6 directions
1 = All cells are randomly spin-seeded
2 = All cells completely aligned in zero direction
4) seedSpin_func is now modified to seedSpin_func_dir to distinguish the modifications. The variable allConfig in dir has been modified.
